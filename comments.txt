A single line comment may be introduced by “inane” and extends to the next newline. A multi-line comment
may be introduced by the special “I'd [just] like to interject” keyword and terminated with “Linux”. If, for any
reason, the “Linux” word wants to be taken as a literal, it may be escaped by the special form “GNU/Linux”
which will not terminate the comment. The “just” word is optional. Both comment forms are case sensitive.

`inane [comment]`
`I'd like to interject [comment] Linux`
`I'd just like to interject [comment] Linux`
