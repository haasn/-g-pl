A /g/pl source file may be given meta information with the tripfaggotry block. 
A tripfaggotry block is not necessary, it may be omitted if you don't want to include
extra information.
Inside this block, data is ordered with a key and a value. Both fields are strings.
The block begins with a line 'tripfaggotry' (nothing else can be on this line) and ends
with a line 'filtered' (as before, nothing else can be on this line).
The data pairs are organized as 'key:value'.

An example:

`tripfaggotry
	author: graydude
	name: example in documentation
	date: 05-11-2011
filtered`

Any string that doesn't contain a ':' can be used as a key, the draft does not 
limit the keys to a certain set.

We propose that the following keys are used for the following data, so people
can assume this when writing an application that parses the data.

key		| data
author		| The author of the code
name		| The name of the program
date		| The date the program was last modified, formatted dd-mm-yyyy
