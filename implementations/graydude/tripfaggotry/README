This is the implementation for the proposed tripfaggotry expression, not in the standard yet.

The goal of the expression/block is to provide some documentation, much like how JavaDoc works.

The block starts with:

	tripfaggotry

and ends with:

	filtered

The block content is a collection of keys and data. Everything is a string.

Example:

trifaggotry
	author: graydude
	name: example program
	date: 5-11-2011
filtered

This document does not yet provide any standards on what keys should be used.
