Functions may be created using the following syntax:

`>function([name...]) [body]` (name :: Name; body :: Expression)

If the () is empty, it may be omitted - so `>function [body]` is the same as `>function() [body]`

Functions may be called using the following syntax:
`>[name] [parameter...];` (name :: Function Expression; parameters :: Expression)

A function call's parameters, as well as the name and the first parameter, may be separated by any sort of
whitespace including tabs, newlines and spaces. They are explicitly terminated by a semicolon. Function
calls and creations are expressions.

A function expression is a regular expression with the exception of literals. This was introduced to solve some
ambiguity issues during parsing.

Functions, as mentioned above, carry with them a special scope. When a function is created, their scope is assigned
the current scope in which they were created. If this function gets passed elsewhere, that scope gets passed along with
them.

What happens when you call a function is that a new scope is created /inside/ the function's execution scope,
with each of the named parameters being created there with the type and value of the parameter's expression, which
are evaluated from left to right.

If you result an intermediate function directly, eg. `>>function(x) >add x x; 5;`, what happens is that the intermediate
value of the first expression (“>function(x) >add x x;”), which carries with it a special scope (that is not normally
known for expressions but was assigned during its creation) is executed immediately as detailed above. This means that
a new scope is created inside the function's execution scope (which is the current), with the Integer “x” set to “5”.

“>add x x;” is then evaluated as normal inside that scope, which means that the closest bound ‘x’, in this case the
one inside its own scope, gets added to itself, and the result of that expression gets carried upwards during evaluation.

So writing `>mfw >>function(x) >add x x; 5;;` will output a “10”.

Attempting to call a variable that is not a function (eg. an integer or a string) will result in a fatal error.
