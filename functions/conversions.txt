= float(value) =

 This built-in will parse the contents of “value” to a float if possible (fatal error otherwise). Works on strings,
 floats and ints.

= string(value) =

 This built-in will turn the value into a string representation. Works on every type!

= int(value) =

 This built-in will turn the value into an integer type. Works on strings, floats and ints. If used on a float,
 rounding occurs.

= bool(value) =

 This built-in will turn the value into a boolean type. Works only on strings! Please do not attempt using numbers
 as truth values. (If this function supported numbers, 0 would be ambiguous between “true” and “false” depending
 on context)
