= is(a, b) =

 This does a comparison. The only cross-type comparisons that are allowed are float and integer, always
 return false. Commparisons between functions always return false.

= smaller(a, b) =

 Works only on integers and floats (the two may be compared). Returns true if a < b, false otherwise.
