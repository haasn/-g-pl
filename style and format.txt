Sequenced expressions are separated by whitespace (with or without newlines).  All source files are explicitly
UTF-8, and all names may include special UTF runes provided they are not in the group of whitespace or control
characters.

Top level expressions may *only* be >implying expressions, any and all execution will have to be inside an OP
function. When a file is interpreted, all of its >implications are first processed from top to bottom, and then
the OP function is called if it exists.
