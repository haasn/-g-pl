Any and all of the names used here serve merely as placeholder and may or may not indicate their final form in
whole or in part. Where no suitable suggestion was found, a descriptive placeholder was inserted for brevity.

Where source code is introduced into this article, it is surrounded by a pair of backquotes (‘`’)
Placeholders inside source code are surround by square brackets (‘[’ and ‘]’). A source code snippet containing
placeholders may be followed by a section describing the nature of placeholders in the form “(name :: kind)”
where name is the name of a placeholder, and kind describes what that placeholder may be (see Terminology section).
If a placeholder is not mentioned, it is assumed to be anything. Multiple placeholder descriptions may be separated
by a semicolon (‘;’).
